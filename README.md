Hey there, LinkedIn enthusiasts! 👋 Tired of plain, boring posts? Say hello to inEditor - your new best friend for crafting eye-catching LinkedIn posts!

**Check it out live**: https://ineditor.deno.dev/

## What's the fuss about?
LinkedIn doesn't have a built-in text editor for posts (boo! 👎). But fear not! inEditor is here to save the day, letting you add some pizzazz to your posts with **bold**, *italic*, underlined, and ~~strikethrough~~ text. No more boring posts for you!

## Getting Started (It's super easy!)
1. Clone this repo (you know the drill!)
2. Hop into the folder
3. Run `npm install` to get all the goodies
4. Fire it up with `node index.js`
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` and start styling!

## Current Superpowers (Alpha Release)
- **Bold**: Make your words stand out! 💪
- *Italic*: Add some flair and emphasis!
- Underline: Because sometimes you need to underline stuff
- ~~Strikethrough~~: For when you change your mind mid-sentence
- Copy function: Easy peasy copy-paste!
- Numbered lists: Organize your thoughts in order
- Bullet points: Perfect for quick, easy-to-read lists

## What's New?
We've added some exciting new features to make your posts even more engaging:

1. **Numbered Lists**: Great for step-by-step instructions or prioritized points.
2. **Bullet Points**: Ideal for unordered lists or highlighting key ideas.

These additions will help you structure your content more effectively and make your posts easier to read and understand.

## What's Cooking?
We're constantly working on improving inEditor. Some features are in development, while others might be refined or removed based on user feedback. Stay tuned for updates!

## Known Quirks
Currently, only the features mentioned above are fully functional. We're working on perfecting other features and ironing out any kinks.
