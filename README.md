# inEditor: Your LinkedIn Post Buddy! 📝✨

![inEditor in action](https://github.com/ceroberoz/inEditor/blob/meong/capture.png "inEditor - Alpha Release")

Hey there, LinkedIn enthusiasts! 👋 Tired of plain, boring posts? Say hello to inEditor - your new best friend for crafting eye-catching LinkedIn posts!

**Check it out live**: https://ineditor.deno.dev/

## What's the fuss about?
LinkedIn doesn't have a built-in text editor for posts (boo! 👎). But fear not! inEditor is here to save the day, letting you add some pizzazz to your posts with **bold**, *italic*, underlined, and ~~strikethrough~~ text. No more boring posts for you!

## Getting Started (It's super easy!)
1. Clone this repo (you know the drill!)
2. Hop into the folder
3. Run `npm install` to get all the goodies
4. Fire it up with `node index.js`
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` and start styling!

## Current Superpowers (Alpha Release)
- **Bold**: Make your words stand out! 💪
- *Italic*: Add some flair and emphasis!
- Underline: Because sometimes you need to underline stuff
- ~~Strikethrough~~: For when you change your mind mid-sentence
- Copy function: Easy peasy copy-paste!

## What's Cooking?
We're working on making inEditor even more awesome! Some features are in the works, while others might be saying goodbye. Stay tuned for updates!

## Known Quirks
Right now, only the features mentioned above are working their magic. The rest are either on vacation or getting a makeover.

## Help Us Grow!
Love inEditor? Have ideas to make it even better? We'd love to hear from you! Feel free to contribute, suggest features, or just say hi!

Happy posting, LinkedIn rockstars! 🌟
=======
Therefore for basic styling such as bold, italics, underline & strike text must be done by 3rd party app and I am not feeling OK by sharing my article without gods know what my article will be use for. (My worries) Is it for another AI feeds for same service? 

Eww I only want text formatting bro. At least I can put **BOLD** or _ITALIC_ into my LinkedIn Posts. (Fact)

### Alpha release ####
As of now only Bold & Copy function that working.

Other function are either WIP or will be remove in the future.

---

*Known issue:*
- Italics: some unicode cause AWOL during text selection; avoid use Italic on e, g, E, G, R.
- Underline & strike styling done by CSS.
