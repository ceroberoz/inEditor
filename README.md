## Tech Stack

- [Deno](https://deno.land/): A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript
- [Oak](https://oakserver.github.io/oak/): A middleware framework for Deno's http server
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs)): For AI-powered suggestions
- [Quill.js](https://quilljs.com/): Rich text editor
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Utility-first CSS framework

## AI Functionality

We've separated the AI functionality into its own module (`aiAssist.ts`) for better organization and maintainability. Key improvements include:

- Multiple AI models with prioritization
- Health checks to ensure model availability
- Automatic fallback if a model fails
- Inclusion of the AI model name and original prompt in the generated post

Our AI models include:
1. Google's Gemini Pro 1.5 (Experimental)
2. Meta's LLaMA 3 8B
3. Mistral AI's 7B Instruct
4. Anthropic's Claude 2
5. Google's Gemma 2 9B
... and more!

Each model has its strengths, ensuring high-quality post suggestions across various topics and styles.

## Project Structure

### Development Exercises

1. Add a new AI model to the `models` array in `aiAssist.ts`.
2. Implement a new text styling option in the Quill editor.
3. Create a new API endpoint for user feedback on AI suggestions.

## Troubleshooting

- If you're having issues with API keys, make sure they're correctly set in your `.env` file.
- For CORS errors, check that your `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in the `.env` file includes your frontend URL.
- If an AI model is consistently failing, try adjusting the order in the `models` array in `aiAssist.ts`.
