# inEditor: Your LinkedIn Post Buddy! 📝✨

![inEditor in action](https://github.com/ceroberoz/inEditor/blob/meong/capture.png "inEditor - Alpha Release")

Hey there, LinkedIn enthusiasts! 👋 Tired of plain, boring posts? Say hello to inEditor - your new best friend for crafting eye-catching LinkedIn posts!

**Check it out live**: https://ineditor.deno.dev/

## What's the fuss about?
LinkedIn doesn't have a built-in text editor for posts (boo! 👎). But fear not! inEditor is here to save the day, letting you add some pizzazz to your posts with **bold**, *italic*, underlined, and ~~strikethrough~~ text. No more boring posts for you!

## Getting Started (It's super easy!)
1. Clone this repo (you know the drill!)
2. Hop into the folder
3. Run `npm install` to get all the goodies
4. Fire it up with `node index.js`
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` and start styling!

## Current Superpowers (Alpha Release)
- **Bold**: Make your words stand out! 💪
- *Italic*: Add some flair and emphasis!
- Underline: Because sometimes you need to underline stuff
- ~~Strikethrough~~: For when you change your mind mid-sentence
- Copy function: Easy peasy copy-paste!

## What's Cooking?
We're working on making inEditor even more awesome! Some features are in the works, while others might be saying goodbye. Stay tuned for updates!

## Known Quirks
Right now, only the features mentioned above are working their magic. The rest are either on vacation or getting a makeover.

## Help Us Grow!
Love inEditor? Have ideas to make it even better? We'd love to hear from you! Feel free to contribute, suggest features, or just say hi!
